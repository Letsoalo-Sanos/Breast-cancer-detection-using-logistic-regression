## Model Training and Evaluation

This section outlines the full process for training and evaluating a logistic regression model using the cleaned breast cancer dataset.

---

### Train-Test Split

We begin by dividing the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.

### Model Evaluation

- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual assessment of TP, FP, TN, FN
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures classification success rate
